# Webserver-for-ESP8266-4-ch-relay

It has has to be in "mode 1", with red Led on.  The built-in software works but registering to some remote server sucks as always.

Added now a push-button to top of the main unit. You can morse 1-4 to turn a relay on. Long press = all off.

Made preliminary Python version now. No unscrewing needed. I can update the programming via de Interwebs.
